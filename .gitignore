# Conda/Python Environment Files

# Data Files (Important: Only ignore processed/derived data, NOT raw data you want to track)
# Consider ignoring large output files or intermediate data that can be regenerated.
# For example, if your notebooks generate large CSVs or plots:
# output/             # Folder for generated output files
# *.csv               # If these are large, generated CSVs
# *.txt               # If these are large, generated TXT files
# *.zip
# *.tar.gz
# *.pkl               # Python pickle files (often large and not suitable for version control)

# IDE and Editor Files
.vscode/              # Visual Studio Code settings
.idea/                # IntelliJ/PyCharm settings
*.swp                 # Vim swap files
*~                    # Emacs backup files

# Miscellaneous
*.log                 # Log files
*.bak                 # Backup files
